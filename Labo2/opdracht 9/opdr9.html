<h1>404! Page Not Found! Ahhhh! Panic!</h1>
<p>Well. Damn. There’s been a wee boob. <strong>The page you’re looking for can’t be found.</strong> Try not to actually panic, though. The authorities have been notified.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>This upsetting circumstance may be because…</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>We messed up.</strong> In which case we’re very sorry. The person responsible will be fired. And cast out into the wilderness.</li>
    <li><strong>A link you followed to get here was in error.</strong> In which case someone else should be sorry.</li>
    <li><strong>You mistyped a web address.</strong> In which case Michael Buble should be sorry. Because Michael Buble should always be sorry.</li>
</ul>
